	My name is <b>Maria Deslis</b> and I am Software Developer. 
</p>
<p>
	I have done full stack development most of my life. What I am intrigued by and enjoy the most, however, is front-end part of coding, such as user interface and design. I like making it intuitive, inviting, and enganging to users - especially when it comes to video games. I firmly believe that video games have the <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world" target="_blank">power to change the world for the better</a> and my goal is to one day have my games in the world and be a part of the gaming industry. I have recently started <a href="http://www.pygame.org/news.html" target="_blank">learning PyGame</a> so as to reach that goal. 
</p>
<p>
	I am currently studying AngularJS, MVC, and the Unity Engine when I can. In my free time I love: </br>
	<ul>
		<li>gaming</li>
		<li>crafting anything I can get my hands on</li>
		<li>painting and drawing</li> 
		<li>playing piano</li>
		<li>hanging out with my cat and my friends</li>
		<li>learning and expanding my skill set.</li>
	</ul>
