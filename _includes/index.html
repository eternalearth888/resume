				I am currently graduate student at CU Boulder under the ATLAS MS-CTD (Creative Technologies and Design) program.

				"CTD graduates are creative problem solvers. Through project-based learning, students
				gain technical fluency, designing systems and products to realize their creative visions. CTD students are not just
				design thinkers; theyâ€™re creative technologists equipped with portfolios of thoughtful projects and prototypes."

				I have done full stack software/web/mobile development most of my life. 
				What I am intrigued by and enjoy the most, however, is front-end part of coding, 
				such as user interface and design. I like making it intuitive, inviting, and enganging to users - 
				especially when it comes to video games. 
				I firmly believe that video games have the 
				<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world" target="_blank">
					power to change the world for the better</a> and my goal is to one day have my games in the world
					and be a part of the gaming industry.
				<br/>
				I am working on achieving these goals through my Master's program and beyond!
